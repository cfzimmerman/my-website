    Between my first and second years of college, I got involved with a startup
    and eventually took a year off school to pursue it as a technical
    co-founder.
    <br /> <br />
    As my first real introduction to software engineering, Render gave me a
    strong foundation in full stack development and a basic understanding of
    modern web app architecture.
    <br /> <br />
    The codebase was held privately, but {"here's"} a video{" "}
    <a href="https://youtu.be/fp9qIQecDdw">walkthrough</a> of what I built.

    As a college freshman, I joined Harvard Student Agencies, a club/business

    Working on small teams in both the education and marketing agencies, we
    developed relationships with international businesses (especially in India
    and China) and iconic brands like Red Bull, Grammarly, and Fj√§llr√§ven while
    closing more than $385k in contracts.
