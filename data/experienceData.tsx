    As a CS 51 final project, I built an interpreter and REPL in OCaml. Valid
    OCaml expressions are read in, parsed into a meta language, evaluated, and
    printed.

    Most of the project was spent building and abstracting different semantic
    evaluators. Checkout the demo video and readme on GitHub for more info!

    Some friends with an ML company hired me to build a semantic search app.
    They collected, cleaned, and processed the searchable data and gave me a CSV
    with some designs.
    <br /> <br />
    I turned that into a product! Doing so involved setting up modular
    infrastructure for vector management, building unit-tested libraries for
    processing queries, and setting up a REST API to handle requests. I also
    built an SSR frontend with Next, set up a client-side library to handle I/O,
    and deployed the service on Heroku.
