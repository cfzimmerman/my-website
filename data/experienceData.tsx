    Between my first and second years of college, I got involved in a startup
    and eventually took a year off school to pursue it as a technical
    co-founder.
    <br /> <br />
    As a hands-on introduction to software engineering, Render gave me a strong
    foundation in full stack development and a basic understanding of modern web
    app architecture.
    <br /> <br />
    The codebase was held privately, but {"here's"} a video{" "}
    <a href="https://youtu.be/fp9qIQecDdw">demo</a> of what I built.
